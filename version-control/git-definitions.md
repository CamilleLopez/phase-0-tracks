# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? It allows for incremental changes to be made with a backup point and remote copy for collaborators to also make edits. This allows for features to be updated in an organized way rather than all at once, with no clear save points. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is created with the git checkout -b "branchname" command, it's best practice to use it each time you're introducing a new feature. This allows for an organized way to compare before and after versions as well as look at feature changes one at a time. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point, after modifications are staged. A good commit message is meaningful ,specific, and is committed often. 
* What is a merge conflict?- it's when 2 branches change the same portion of your file , say two team mebers do this at the same time, and then a disreprency occurs on how to merge those different changes. You can resolve this manually in the text editor.
